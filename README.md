This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## 🧠 Claude AI Development System

This project uses a shared Claude Code memory system in `.claude/`

### First time setup
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude
```
Then add your name to `.claude/settings.local.json`:
```json
{ "developerName": "Your Name Here" }
```
Then run `/r-memory-scan` to build your memory.

### Daily workflow
```
/r-start              → load memory, see project status
/r-todo               → see all pending tasks
/r-pickup             → pick up a task to work on
/r-task [desc]        → execute any task
/r-plan [feature]     → plan a big feature before coding
/r-fix [desc]         → diagnose and fix a bug
/r-done               → mark current task as complete
/r-end                → end of day summary
```

### Team rules
- Commit all `.claude/` changes after tasks
- Only `settings.local.json` and `tasks/eod/` are personal/gitignored
- Add tasks for teammates with `/r-add-task`
- Update module memory after touching any module
